# TurboCookedRabbit
 A user friendly RabbitMQ written in Golang.  
 Based on my work found at [CookedRabbit](https://github.com/houseofcat/CookedRabbit).

### Developer's Notes
It was programmed against the following:

 * Golang 1.13.0
 * RabbitMQ Server v3.7.17 (simple localhost)
 * Erlang v22.0 (OTP v10.4)

If you see any issues with more advanced setups, I will need an intimate description of the setup. Without it, I more than likely won't be able to resolve it. I can accept PRs if you want to test out fixes that resolve things for yourself.

I also don't have the kind of free time I used to, I apologize in advance but hey that's life. So keep in mind that I am not paid to do this - this isn't my job, this isn't a corporate sponsorship.
